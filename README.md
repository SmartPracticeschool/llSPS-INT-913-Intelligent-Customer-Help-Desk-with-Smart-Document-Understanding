Intelligent Customer Helpdesk with Smart Document Understanding.This project isworking example of a web app that utilizes multiple Watson services to create a better customer care experience.
Made under the guidance of Smartinternz Internship Program at smartbrigde.
#Project Description-with the use of Watson Discovery Smart Document Understanding (SDU) feature, enhancement of Discovery model is done so that queries that falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, will be better focused to  search the most relevant information found in a typical owner's manual which has been pre-loaded .
With the help of Watson Assistant,  a standard customer care dialog will handle a typical conversation between a custmomer and a company representitive. When a customer's question involves operation of a product, the Assistant dialog will communicate with the Discovery service using a webhook.
The webhook(a mechanism that allows you to call out to an external program based on something happening in your program) will be created by defining a web action using IBM Cloud Functions.
All these services are integrated in Node-red App which serves as an interface for a customer .
